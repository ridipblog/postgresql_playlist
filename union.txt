The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more queries.

The queries in the union must follow these rules:

They must have the same number of columns
The columns must have the same data types
The columns must be in the same order

    examle ->
        SELECT product_id, product_name
        FROM products
        UNION
        SELECT testproduct_id, product_name
        FROM testproducts
        ORDER BY product_id;
    example 2 ->
        SELECT product_id
        FROM products
        UNION
        SELECT testproduct_id
        FROM testproducts
        ORDER BY product_id;
    example 3 ->
        SELECT product_id
        FROM products
        UNION ALL
        SELECT testproduct_id
        FROM testproducts
        ORDER BY product_id;
